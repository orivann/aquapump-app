# AquaPump frontend container assets

The main React application lives at the repository root (`src/`, `package.json`, etc.). This directory only contains the Dockerfile that builds the production-ready frontend image and any ancillary container assets that may be added later.

For development instructions, see the root [`README.md`](../README.md).
